           <p>           
           The people that will visit my site are people wanting to improve or learn more about fitness. My main focus is muscle hypertrophy and dieting, which are the subjects I've studied over the years.
           I want to focus on the people with entry level knowledge on the subject, so I will lay out the information, in a manner that is understandable by everyone but still interesting for people on all levels of fitness. Nowadays there's a lot of information around in regards to fitness and training,
           much of it is either outdated or taken out of context just for the interest of selling a particular supplement or training program, that's why I'll try to be as objective as possible, providing support for the information with medical researches as well as my experience on the subject.
           I also want to encourage people to pursue realistic fitness goals instead of the over-the-top, non-realistic physiques that we see on social media, I want to help people have a healthier live by exercising and developing healthy eating habits.

           <p>           
            I want to provide encouragement through my fitness journey, by explaining the work and sacrifices I had to do in order to become a 2nd place winner in a bodybuilding contest, how I built the discipline and the knowledge needed to overcome that challenge.
             I want to differentiate the different levels of commitment between being an active person who likes to exercise and a competitive bodybuilder, I’ll also emphasize the secondary effects that too much exercise had in my life and why it’s not needed to do extreme practices if you want to be overall healthy.

        Nowadays, there is a lot of different nutrition plans and diet advices going around in the internet, throughout the years, I’ve heard and read about a lot of different diets meant to reduce body-fat percentage and increase muscle mass, some of those being effective, but the majority being either too aggressive, dangerous or contradictory. 
        I’m not a certified medical nutritionist, therefore my advice might not be applicable to population with health disorders, I will make clear that the advice of a certified doctor will be more effective for their given circumstances. My dieting advice will be based on presenting the evidence that medical researches found and published on medical journals or magazines, 
        together with their degree of certainty and my personal experience gathered by applying those principles in my life. The information that the audience will gather is going to be enough for them to make more educated food choices in relationship with their goals, whether that is to lose or maintain weight, gain muscle or just overall health. 
        Which is different from the common diet templates that people often find on the internet that only provides given food options and portion sizes without considering the broad differences that people have on body complexities and personal goals.

       As a certified personal trainer, I’ve studied multiple training splits and protocols, but as a bodybuilder, my main focus has always been muscle hypertrophy, the latest medical research in regards to this aspect of training is very conclusive, the range of repetitions, the progressions and the exercise selections have been widely studied, 
       giving us a better control of the results we’ll be expecting due to our training. In this section I will focus on the goal of hypertrophy training and how to achieve in the most safe and effective way, I will also compare it with other aspects of training such as endurance, strength, speed, etc. 
       Letting the audience with a deeper knowledge about the different aspects of training as well as methods that will allow them to prioritize the aspects they want to improve on. I will make special emphasis on cardiovascular work due to his ability to improve health markers as well as an efficient way of burning calories, thus enhancing his fat-burning capabilities.
