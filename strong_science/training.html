                <h1>Common training misconceptions</h1>

                <section>

                    <h2>Go hard or go home, Bro!</h2>
                    <p>There's some truth to it, yet it's still poor advice. You should train hard, but safely, in a controlled and programmed manner, following the principles of the results you want to achieve.
                        Going "Hard" doesn't mean lifting heavy, it means lifting closely to concentric muscle failure with good form, in simple words. You should use a weight that allows you to perform the exercise with
                        perfect form, and you should keep repeating the movement until you can't perform another repetition with good form. As a general rule, if you are a beginner, never use weights that don't allow you to
                        perform at least 5 perfect repetitions.

                    <h2>"Weight training will make me look bulky and gain weight"</h2>
                    <p>You'll get some weight gain from lifting weights, it's usually a small amount (around 2kg in A WHOLE YEAR!) and almost exclusively from muscle mass which is not going to give you a bulky look, instead 
                        you'll appear healthier and you will be stronger. If you fear looking like one of those top-class bodybuilders, then don't worry, it takes 10+ years of meticulous daily weight training and sometimes chemical compounds
                        in order to look like that, so don't stress about it and enjoy the process of a healthier lifestyle.

                    <h2>"You have to train every day, all day"</h2>
                    <p>Huge training volumes such as training every single day has proven to even reduce muscle synthesis (muscle gain) meaning that too much exercise is actually bad and counterproductive. at first, going to the gym for 40 minutes 3 days a week is plenty stimulus for most beginners, as a general rule, you have to allow time for your muscles to recover before you train them again, too much frequency or long-lasting sessions should absolutely be avoided for beginners and only considered for advanced lifters who really have a reason to train for that long. Rest is just as important as training itself, and you should respect it if you want the best results
