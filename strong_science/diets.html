                    <button class="accordion">How do you gain or lose weight?</button>
                    <div class="panel">

                        <p>Let's make something clear, from now on, when we talk about "losing weight" we are referring to the decrease of body weight by the loss of body fat while keeping the most amount of muscle mass.
                        Doesn't matter if your goal is to have a more lean and aesthetic body or only the overall health benefits of losing weight, our main goal is to always maintain and even increase the amount of muscle mass
                        and reduce the most amount of body fat. doesn't matter if you are a man or a woman, lean muscle tissue will not only sculpt your body in a good and healthy way, it will also protect your bones, ligaments and
                        tendons!
                        <br><br>Leaving that aside, the way we will gain or lose weight is by controlling part of our daily calorie expenditure, that's is commonly known as the "calories in calories out approach". In simple terms, 
                        weight loss (or weight gain) is primarily determined by the amount of calories ingested, other aspects might be considered like metabolic pathways or carbohydrate and fat proportions but they play just a small 
                        fragment in comparison to the amount of calories consumed
                        <br><br>This is actually a huge debate, mostly because the other approach to weight loss refers to the "Carbohydrate-Insulin Model" Which has proven to be consistent in animal trials, but inconclusive during human trials
                        <br><br>You can read more on the subject on the bibliography links below, there you will find a medical research talking about the subject.</p>

                    <div class="panel">

                        <p>Food is composed of macronutrients and micronutrients, I'll focus mainly on macronutrients because they are the main contributors to the calorie content of the food. Each food has different proportions of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.
                             <br><br>Protein is the building block of muscle tissue, it's also very satiating, packs 4 calories per gram, and has a high thermic effect, meaning that on average, it takes longer for your body to convert it into energy, therefore, protein should be the main focus on your diet. 
                             <br><br>Carbohydrates on the other hand are the main source of energy for your body, they are necessary for various functions, including enhancing your athletic performance, and also pack 4 calories per gram. Next, we have fats, which are the most calorically dense,  with 9 calories per gram.
                             <br><br>Fats are needed for hormonal processes but should be consumed with caution as it's easy to start stacking calories whenever we add oils and fats to our foods. They are all critical, and we must balance them to our needs.

                    <button class="accordion">Which one is the best diet to follow?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                    <p> Nowadays, the internet is full of structured diets, tips and tricks to help you lose weight. Some work, some are complete nonsense and some will leave you will the feeling that you will never be able to lose weight. 
                        thruth is that we all have different preferences, times and level of commitment, that's why my goal here is to teach you what's more or less important in the process of losing/gaining weight, thay way you can make your 
                        own educated decisions regarding to the diet you could follow.

                        <br><br>A very popular diet has come to the attention of multiple people, claiming that it's the definitive diet for weight loss. I'm referring to the ketogenic diet, which is based on the carbohydrate-insulin model. 
                        There are people who claim that it's a easy diet for them to follow and that has helped them to lose weight, if that's your case, then by all means keep controlling your weight as you prefer, for other people, including myself, 
                        we have found that a calorie restriction approach is better and more comfortable for us. In a more specific and measurable manner, doctors have studied this and different other diets and concluded that when you equate calories,
                         all diets have the same effect on weight loss, differing among them the satisfaction of the people following such dietary plans. 

                        <br><br>What can we take from this? Stick with what's better for you. I've linked a study comparing the effects of a ketogenic diet in the bibliography down below.

                        <p>As stated before, we are all very different in regards to our body's structure, we have different heights, different muscle mass and even different bone densities, all of those affect our total weight.
                            that's why we can't just look at a chart and tell which weight should you be on. Instead of that, you focus on how you objectively see and feel, if you are obese or overweight then you should slowly start 
                            losing the extra weight until you get to a more healthier state. If you are underweight, then you should add extra weight until you find yourself at a healthier state.

                    <button class="accordion">How do I control my weight?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                    <p>The best way to control a variable such as weight is by measuring it constantly, the problem is that weight normally fluctuates heavily throughout the day, if you weigh yourself and then drink a glass of water then
                            you will instantly weight about 400gr more, which is not 400gr of extra body fat by any means, but it can totally disrupt all your calculations.
                            <br><br>My recommendation is to weigh yourself once every day and under the same conditions, sounds complicated, but in practice it just means that you should weight yourself after waking up and going to the bathroom,
                            That way you will always be weighing yourself while fasted and with an empty bladder. That's as close as you can get to a fair and consistent weight measurement.
                            <br><br>If your daily measurements are increasing for 7 to 10 days straight, then you probably are eating more calories than your are burning, and you should either reduce calories by eating less or changing foods, or you
                            should increase daily activities, like cycling, jogging, walking, or any form of exercise that includes movement.

                    <button class="accordion">What foods should I avoid?</button>
                    <div class="panel">

                        <p>If your goal is to lose weight, you should reduce the consumption of "high calorically dense foods" that doesn't mean you should avoid it, only consume it with precautions.
                            <br><br>A "high calorically dense foods" are foods that pack a lot of calories in a small portion of food, those foods are normally the ones packed with fats and/or carbohydrates, like chocolate, ice-cream 
                            sodas and junk food in general. Your diet should be composed of nutritious foods that are not dense in calories, that way you can eat more and feel satiated without eating a surplus in calories.
                            <br><br>For example, a tablespoon of nutella has the same calories as 3/4 of a chicken breast, but, the amount of food you get from the chicken is not only bigger but also gives you a better feeling of satiation 
                            than a tablespoon of nutella

                    <button class="accordion">What foods should I eat?</button>
                    <div class="panel">

                        <p>The absolute best predictor for long-lasting weight loss is diet adherence, meaning that your diet should be something that you generally like to eat, you can force yourself to eat chicken and broccoli every day but that will only take you as far as your will power can handle, which is usually not long enough, ultimately making you re-take your old eating habits. Therefore, you have to find a balance between what you "should eat" and what you "want to eat" I do it by having no specific dishes but rather some guidelines. All your meals should be sufficiently high in protein, you should eat between 1 gram to 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily.
                             if your meal is high in fats, then you should cut carbohydrates. If it's high in carbohydrates, then you should cut fats. If it's high on both, then you probably just have to eat a small portion.
                             <br><br>Let's take pasta for example, high in carbohydrates, low in protein and fat. That's why I normally eat my pasta with chicken and a tomato sauce with various veggies, I do not cook any of the ingredients with extra fats or oils.

                    <button class="accordion">How to structure your diet</button>
                    <div class="panel">

                        <p>My reccomendation is to start slow, don't introduce a lot of changes rapidly or you will think about losing weight and exercising as a burden rather than a good lifestyle, technically you should reduce fats and/or carbohydrates 
                            and increase protein, that's easily achieve by swapping french fries for mashed potatoes, rice or a salad, in general you just want to swap food high in calories for other options lower in calories. As a good rule of thumb, you can 
                            start by eating more vegetables and fruit (due to their low calorie content) and less fried food or desserts. If you are like me who enjoys everything as sweet as possible, you should consider using non-nutritive sweeteners (which are proven to be effective at controling weight)
                            or measure the higly calorically dense foods, such as chips or ice-cream. In my case I limit myself to 1 or 2 daily measured portions of my favorite desserts, if my daily bodyweight starts rising, then I just adjust the portions accordingly

                            <br><br>Having that in mind, there's a couple of tips I can give you to structure your diet, let's say a fat loss diet. As a general rule, you would like to standarize your intake, which is a fancy way of saying 
                            "try to eat in a predictable and structured way" if you are the type of person who can go randomly from a 2-day fast, followed by a 4-day binging spree, and then to normal 3 meals per day for the next 4 days, then you probably
                            will have a tought time controlling your weight, because basically, you just dont know what or when you are eating. What I reccomend you is to have 3 to 4 meals every day at the same hour, you can vary the type of food every day, but trying to keep the portions 
                            consistent, that will get you well on your track of controlling your weight. If you keep gaining weight every week, then you should consider making a couple of changes in the portions or the food sources. Try less fatty cuts of meat, start using less cooking oils, add more fruits, or look for a 
                            lower calorie replacement for one of your food items.
