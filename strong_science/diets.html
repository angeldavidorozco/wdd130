                    <h2>How do you gain or lose weight?</h2>
                    <p>Let's make something clear, from now on, when we talk about "losing weight" we are referring to the decrease of body weight by the loss of body fat while keeping the most amount of muscle mass.
                        Doesn't matter if your goal is to have a more lean and aesthetic body or only the overall health benefits of losing weight, our main goal is to always maintain and even increase the amount of muscle mass
                        and reduce the most amount of body fat. doesn't matter if you are a man or a woman, lean muscle tissue will not only sculpt your body in a good and healthy way, it will also protect your bones, ligaments and
                        tendons!
                        <br>Leaving that aside, the way we will gain or lose weight is by controlling part of our daily calorie expenditure, that's is commonly known as the "calories in calories out approach"</p>

                    <h2>Which one is the best diet to follow?</h2>
                    <p>Nowadays, the internet is full of structured diets, tips and tricks to help you lose weight. Some work, some are complete nonsense and some will leave you will the feeling that you will never be able to lose weight. 
                        thruth is that we all have different preferences, times and level of commitment, that's why my goal here is to teach you what's more or less important in the process of losing/gaining weight, thay way you can make your 
                        own educated decisions regarding to the diet you could follow.

                    <h2>How to know your ideal weight?</h2>
                    <p>As stated before, we are all very different in regards to our body's structure, we have different heights, different muscle mass and even different bone densities, all of those affect our total weight.
                        that's why we can't just look at a chart and tell which weight should you be on. Instead of that, you focus on how you objectively see and feel, if you are obese or overweight then you should slowly start 
                        losing the extra weight until you get to a more healthier state. If you are underweight, then you should add extra weight until you find yourself at a healthier state.

                <section>

                    <h2>How do I control my weight?</h2>
                    <p>The best way to control a variable such as weight is by measuring it constantly, the problem is that weight normally fluctuates heavily throughout the day, if you weigh yourself and then drink a glass of water then
                        you will instantly weight about 400gr more, which is not 400gr of extra body fat by any means, but it can totally disrupt all your calculations.
                        <br>My recommendation is to weigh yourself once every day and under the same conditions, sounds complicated, but in practice it just means that you should weight yourself after waking up and going to the bathroom,
                        That way you will always be weighing yourself while fasted and with an empty bladder. That's as close as you can get to a fair and consistent weight measurement.
                        <br>If your daily measurements are increasing for 7 to 10 days straight, then you probably are eating more calories than your are burning, and you should either reduce calories by eating less or changing foods, or you
                        should increase daily activities, like cycling, jogging, walking, or any form of exercise that includes movement.

                    <h2>What foods should I avoid?</h2>
                    <p>If your goal is to lose weight, you should reduce the consumption of "high calorically dense foods" that doesn't mean you should avoid it, only consume it with precautions.
                        <br>A "high calorically dense foods" are foods that pack a lot of calories in a small portion of food, those foods are normally the ones packed with fats and/or carbohydrates, like chocolate, ice-cream 
                        sodas and junk food in general. Your diet should be composed of nutritious foods that are not dense in calories, that way you can eat more and feel satiated without eating a surplus in calories.
                        <br>For example, a tablespoon of nutella has the same calories as 3/4 of a chicken breast, but, the amount of food you get from the chicken is not only bigger but also gives you a better feeling of satiation 
                        than a tablespoon of nutella

                    <h2>How to structure your diet</h2>
                    <p>My reccomendation is to start slow, don't introduce a lot of changes rapidly or you will think about losing weight and exercising as a burden rather than a good lifestyle, technically you should reduce fats and/or carbohydrates 
                        and increase protein, that's easily achieve by swapping french fries for mashed potatoes, rice or a salad, in general you just want to swap food high in calories for other options lower in calories. As a good rule of thumb, you can 
                        start by eating more vegetables and fruit (due to their low calorie content) and less fried food or desserts. If you are like me who enjoys everything as sweet as possible, you should consider using non-nutritive sweeteners (which are proven to be effective at controling weight)
                        or measure the higly calorically dense foods, such as chips or ice-cream. In my case I limit myself to 1 or 2 daily measured portions of my favorite desserts, if my daily bodyweight starts rising, then I just adjust the portions accordingly
