                    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    <p>My name is Angel Orozco and I'm a certified personal trainer, I'm also an amateur bodybuilder and an overall gym nerd. 
                        throughout my lifting years, I've tried to optimize my training and nutrition to get the best out of it as a 100% natural athlete. 
                        I specialize in muscle hypertrofy, that's a subject I've studied for the last few years and what I learned from it helped 
                        me design a plan that adapts to my always-changing needs and schedules. My main goal is to point athletes to the best and safest practices 
                        that will ensure results, but don't get me wrong, there's no magic trick behind it, it's simple but efficient hard work at the correct dosages!
