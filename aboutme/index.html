    <h2>Angelito</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
    <p>I'm Angel, but you can call me Angelito. I'm 22 years old and living in Argentina. my major is Apllied Technology, I'm also studying electronic engineering</p>
    <p>I love to train and I also love to cook, I'm an amateur bodybuilder and this year I also hope to compete in a national natural bodybuilding show. Wish me luck! I'll totally need it hehehe</p>
    <p>But besides all that, I love to code. I have some experience already from my studies on electronics, that's why I'm super excited about this major.</p>
    <p>Currently I'm looking for a job on IT, I would love to get some work experience as I'm learning more about the subject.</p>
